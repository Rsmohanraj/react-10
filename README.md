🔐 A Simple admin panel is built using React that serves as a User detail Holder . It consists of two main components, a dashboard and a List component

📋 📌 List Component: This component is where all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to details are handled. It allows administrators to perform the CRUD operations

Create : users can register by filling out a form with Name, Username, and possibly other metadata.

Retrieve: All existing detail posts are displayed in a 📅 table so that users can view the details of individual posts by clicking on them.

Update: users can edit the content of existing posts. This likely involves displaying a pre-filled form with the current data and allowing admins to make changes.

Delete: Users can remove blog posts from the system. This action might be triggered by clicking a delete button next to each post or through a confirmation dialog.
